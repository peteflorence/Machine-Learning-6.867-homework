% Use the following line _only_ if you're still using LaTeX 2.09.
%\documentstyle[icml2015,epsf,natbib]{article}
% If you rely on Latex2e packages, like most moden people use this:
\documentclass[10pt]{article}

% use Times
\usepackage{times}
% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx} % more modern
%\usepackage{epsfig} % less modern
\usepackage{float}

% For citations
\usepackage{natbib}

% For algorithms
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}
\usepackage{bm}
\usepackage{amssymb,amsmath}


% As of 2011, we use the hyperref package to produce hyperlinks in the
% resulting PDF.  If this breaks your system, please commend out the
% following usepackage line and replace \usepackage{icml2015} with
% \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2015} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Packages hyperref and algorithmic misbehave sometimes.  We can fix
% this with the following command.
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Employ the following version of the ``usepackage'' statement for

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was
% created by Lise Getoor and Tobias Scheffer, it was slightly modified  
% from the 2010 version by Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, 
% slightly modified from the 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and
